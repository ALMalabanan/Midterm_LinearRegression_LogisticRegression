## **Linear Regression** 

### A. What is Linear Regression?

- **Linear regression** is a fundamental algorithm in *supervised machine learning*.
- Used to model relationships between a **dependent variable** (*target*) and one or more **independent variables** (*features*).
- In *simple linear regression*, a single feature is used to predict a continuous output variable.
- *Multiple linear regression* uses several features to predict a continuous output.
- Widely applied across fields like **economics**, **biology**, and **real estate** to analyze and predict trends.
- In this project, linear regression will predict the **median value of homes** in various **Boston suburbs** based on socio-economic and environmental factors.

### B. Overview of Linear Regression for the Boston Housing Dataset

- **Goal**: Predict the **median value of owner-occupied homes** (*target variable: MEDV*) based on factors such as:
  - **CRIM** - *Crime rate per capita*
  - **RM** - *Average number of rooms per dwelling*
  - **RAD** - *Proximity to highways*
- Key questions addressed include:
  - How environmental factors like **air quality** (*NOX*) or **proximity to Charles River** (*CHAS*) impact home values.
  - Whether **property taxes** (*TAX*) and **pupil-teacher ratios** (*PTRATIO*) correlate with lower housing prices.
  - If socio-economic factors, such as **crime rate** (*CRIM*) or **percentage of lower-status residents** (*LSTAT*), explain fluctuations in real estate prices.

### C. Dataset Description

- **Boston Housing Dataset** contains data from the 1970 Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (*SMSA*).
- **Entries**: 505 towns/suburbs.
- **Features**:
  - **CRIM**: *Per capita crime rate by town*
  - **ZN**: *Proportion of residential land for large lots*
  - **INDUS**: *Non-retail business acres per town*
  - **CHAS**: *Town proximity to Charles River (1 = Yes, 0 = No)*
  - **NOX**: *Nitric oxide concentration*
  - **RM**: *Average number of rooms per dwelling*
  - **AGE**: *Owner-occupied units built before 1940*
  - **DIS**: *Distance to employment centers*
  - **RAD**: *Highway accessibility index*
  - **TAX**: *Property tax rate per $10,000*
  - **PTRATIO**: *Pupil-teacher ratio*
  - **B**: *Racial diversity measure*
  - **LSTAT**: *Percentage of lower-status residents*
  - **MEDV**: *Median home value* - the target variable for prediction.
 
### D. Why MEDV Should Be the Dependent Variable
- `MEDV` represents the median home price, which is typically the main target for prediction in real estate datasets.
- Predicting `MEDV` can provide insights into housing market trends, affordability, and property valuations in Boston’s suburbs.
- Most features in this dataset (e.g., crime rate, number of rooms, accessibility to highways) influence home values, making `MEDV` an appropriate target for regression analysis.

### E. Data Type of MEDV
- `MEDV` is **continuous**, as it represents home prices, which can take a range of numerical values, not limited to categories or fixed intervals.

### F. Appropriateness for Linear Regression
- Since `MEDV` is a continuous variable, it is suitable for linear regression, which predicts continuous outcomes.
- Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the target and predictor variables. This can help model how various factors like room count or crime rate contribute to home price fluctuations.

### G. Initial Observation of the Dataset

- **Potential Non-Linear Relationships:** Some features (e.g., crime rate) may have a non-linear relationship with `MEDV`, which might affect linear regression's performance.
- **Outliers in `MEDV`:** The dataset may contain outliers in home prices, which could skew predictions and reduce model accuracy.
- **Feature Multicollinearity:** There might be correlations among features (e.g., `NOX` and `INDUS`), which could introduce multicollinearity issues.
- **Skewed Distributions:** Certain variables may have skewed distributions, potentially influencing regression results and suggesting the need for feature transformation or regularization.

### H. Methodology

1. **Importing Libraries and Loading Data**

   - Removed rows where `MEDV` was at the cap (≥50.0) for improved prediction accuracy.

5. **Distribution Analysis**
   - Visualized each feature’s distribution to assess skewness:
     - Noted that `CRIM`, `ZN`, and `B` were highly skewed, indicating possible need for transformation.
     - Observed `MEDV` and other features had near-normal or bimodal distributions.

6. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Used a heatmap to examine feature correlations.
   - Selected features with correlation scores > 0.5 for `MEDV` as strong predictors, such as `LSTAT`, `INDUS`, `NOX`, `PTRATIO`, and `RM`.

7. **Feature Transformation and Scaling**
   - Applied `MinMaxScaler` to normalize predictor variables and visualized selected predictors against `MEDV`.
   - Performed log transformations on skewed features to reduce skewness and improve linearity.

8. **Data Splitting**
   - Defined features (`X`) and target variable (`y`), with `MEDV` as the dependent variable.
   - Split data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test) to enable model training and evaluation.

9. **Feature Scaling for Model Training**
   - Scaled `X_train` and `X_test` data using `StandardScaler` for optimal model performance in the regression model.

10. **Model Training**
    - Initialized and trained a `LinearRegression` model on the scaled training data using `model.fit()`.

11. **Prediction and Cross-Validation**
    - Used the trained model to predict `MEDV` on test data.
    - Calculated mean squared error (MSE) as a cross-validation metric.

12. **Model Evaluation Metrics**
    - Calculated `R-squared` and `Adjusted R-squared` values to assess model performance.
    - Printed the model’s coefficients and intercept to understand feature importance.

13. **Comparison of Actual vs. Predicted Values**
    - Created a DataFrame to compare actual `MEDV` values with predicted values and displayed the first ten rows.

14. **Visualizing Model Performance**
    - **Scatter Plot**: Compared actual vs. predicted values with a perfect prediction line to evaluate model accuracy visually.
    - **Residual Plot**: Plotted residuals (errors) against predictions to check for random distribution around zero, indicating model fit quality.
   
### I. Summary of Findings

1. **Model Performance Metrics**
   - **Cross-Validation Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 8.1495
     - This value quantifies the average squared differences between the predicted and actual `MEDV` values. The lower the MSE, the better the model fits the data.
     - Here, an MSE of 8.1495 suggests that the model is relatively accurate, though there is still some prediction error, potentially due to noise or non-linear relationships in the data.
   - **R-squared (R²)**: 0.8284
     - The R² value shows the proportion of variance in `MEDV` that is explained by the model’s features.
     - An R² of 0.8284 means that about 82.8% of the variance in housing prices is captured by this model, indicating a strong fit.
   - **Adjusted R-squared**: 0.8018
     - The Adjusted R² compensates for the number of predictors, adjusting R² downward if unnecessary variables are included.
     - Here, an adjusted R² of 0.8018 suggests that most predictors are relevant, as there is only a slight reduction from the standard R².
    
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.23**
     - On average, the model's predictions are **only 2.23 units away** from the actual values, indicating **consistent and reliable predictions** close to real data.
     - This low MAE demonstrates that the model maintains a **strong ability to generalize**, keeping most predictions close to observed values.

   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 2.85**
     - The RMSE of 2.85, close to the MAE, reflects that **most predictions have small deviations** from the actual values.
     - The RMSE slightly higher than MAE suggests that the model **handles variations well**, capturing both the general trend and some of the outliers effectively.
     - This RMSE value showcases the model’s **robust performance** across different data points.

2. **Feature Impact Analysis (Model Coefficients)**
   - Coefficients represent the impact of each feature on `MEDV`. A positive coefficient implies that an increase in the feature value will increase `MEDV`, while a negative coefficient implies the opposite.
   - The table below details each feature’s coefficient:

| Feature        | Coefficient | Interpretation                                                                                     |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **RM**         | 2.5128      | Average number of rooms per dwelling has the strongest positive impact, showing that larger homes are valued higher. |
| **AGE**        | -0.5803     | Older properties are slightly less valuable, potentially due to wear or less modern features. |
| **DIS**        | -2.5656     | Greater distance from employment centers decreases prices, indicating a preference for proximity to work. |
| **RAD**        | 2.4216      | Accessibility to highways slightly increases prices, suggesting improved commute convenience. |
| **TAX**        | -2.4339     | Higher property tax rates are associated with lower prices, as it increases the cost of owning property. |
| **PTRATIO**    | -1.9463     | Higher student-teacher ratios negatively impact housing prices, likely reflecting school quality perceptions. |
| **B**          | 0.8237      | A higher proportion of African American residents slightly increases housing prices.              |
| **LSTAT**      | -2.5557     | Higher percentage of lower-status individuals significantly decreases prices, reflecting socioeconomic impact. |
| **Intercept**  | 21.6681     | Baseline housing price when all predictors are zero; not directly interpretable due to lack of practical context. |


3. **Comparison of Actual vs. Predicted Prices**
   - The table below provides a comparison of actual and predicted `MEDV` values, showing the model’s accuracy in specific instances.

| Index | Actual Values | Predicted Values |

### J. Why Other Models Perform Better Than Linear Regression

#### Reasons why Random Forest and XGBoost often perform better than Linear Regression for the Boston housing dataset:

- **Captures Non-linear Relationships:** Random Forest and XGBoost can model complex, non-linear relationships, while Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between input features and output.

- **Feature Interaction Handling:** These ensemble models can automatically capture interactions between features, which often exist in real-world data but aren't accounted for in linear regression without manual feature engineering.

- **Less Impact from Outliers:** Ensemble models are less sensitive to outliers in the data. Linear Regression, on the other hand, is highly influenced by outliers, which can skew predictions.

- **Robustness with Collinearity:** If input features are correlated (multicollinearity), Random Forest and XGBoost handle it better. Linear Regression is sensitive to multicollinearity, which can reduce its accuracy.

- **Better Performance on High-dimensional Data:** Both Random Forest and XGBoost tend to perform well even with high-dimensional and complex datasets due to their ensemble nature.

- **Automatic Feature Importance Evaluation:** These models can assess feature importance, helping in selecting the most influential features. Linear Regression requires separate statistical tests to determine feature importance.


## **Logistic Regression**

### A. What is Logistic Regression?

- **Logistic regression** is a popular algorithm in *supervised machine learning* primarily used for **classification tasks**.
- Models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular **class or category**.
- Useful when the **dependent variable** is **binary** (e.g., 0 or 1, Yes or No, True or False).
- The algorithm estimates the **likelihood** of an event happening by fitting data to a **logistic function** (also called a sigmoid function).
- Extends to **multiclass classification** through methods like *One-vs-Rest (OvR)* or *Softmax Regression*.
- Commonly applied in fields like **medicine** (e.g., disease prediction), **finance** (e.g., loan approval), and **marketing** (e.g., customer churn prediction).
- In logistic regression, instead of predicting exact values, the model predicts **probabilities** and maps them to classes based on a **decision threshold** (usually 0.5).


### B. Dataset for Logistic Regression (Pima Indian Diabetes)

- Used for **binary classification** tasks, like predicting diabetes.
- **Features**:
  - **Pregnancies**: *Number of times the patient was pregnant.*
  - **Glucose**: *Plasma glucose concentration post-oral glucose tolerance test.*
  - **Blood Pressure**: *Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).*
  - **Skin Thickness**: *Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).*
  - **Insulin**: *Serum insulin levels post-test (mu U/ml).*
  - **BMI**: *Body mass index.*
  - **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: *Genetic predisposition score.*
  - **Age**: *Patient age.*
  - **Outcome**: *Diabetes presence (1) or absence (0).*
 
### C. Why "Outcome" (Presence of Diabetes) Should Be the Dependent Variable
  - The "Outcome" column represents whether or not an individual has diabetes, coded as:
    - `1` for diabetic
    - `0` for non-diabetic
  - Since the goal of the analysis is to predict diabetes presence based on other factors, "Outcome" naturally serves as the dependent variable.

### D. Data Type of the "Outcome" Variable
  - **Categorical**
  - The variable "Outcome" is binary, representing two distinct categories (diabetic and non-diabetic).

### E. Appropriateness for Logistic Regression
  - Logistic regression is well-suited for binary outcomes, as it estimates the probability of an observation belonging to one of two categories.
  - The logistic function constrains output to a range between `0` and `1`, making it ideal for probability-based classification.

### F. Initial Observations of the Dataset
  - **Potential Issues:**
    - Several columns (e.g., `Insulin` and `SkinThickness`) have zeros where actual values should be present, possibly indicating missing data.
    - Zero values for attributes like `BloodPressure` and `BMI` may also indicate data entry issues, as these values are biologically implausible.
  - **Patterns:**
    - Columns such as `Pregnancies`, `BMI`, `Age`, and `Glucose` could show a correlation with the "Outcome" variable, which logistic regression can help identify.
  - **Size and Balance:**
    - The dataset contains 768 entries, which is moderately sized for logistic regression analysis.
    - It's useful to further examine the balance between classes (i.e., counts of `0` vs. `1` in "Outcome") for potential imbalance, which could affect model performance.


### G. Methodology

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - Imports essential libraries for data manipulation **(pandas)**, numerical operations **(numpy)**, and model evaluation.
   -  **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for data splitting, scaling, modeling, and evaluation.
2. **Loading Dataset**:

   - The **info()** method provides a summary of the dataset, including data types and non-null counts.
3. **Checking for Missing Values**:
   - Checks for any missing values in the dataset, which is crucial for data quality before training the model.
4. **Defining Features and Target Variable**:
   - **X** contains all the feature columns (inputs), while **y** contains the target variable (output), indicating diabetes presence.
5. **Data Split**:
   - Allocates 20% of the data for **testing** and 80% for **training**.
6. **Standardizing Features**:
   - This is used to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
7. **Visualizing Feature Distributions Using Boxplots**:
   - To compare the distributions of various features in the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset with respect to the target variable **(Outcome)**, using boxplots to identify trends, outliers, and distribution differences.
8. **Visualizing Corelation using Heatmap**:
    - To analyze the correlation between different features in the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, helping to identify relationships and potential predictors for the target variable **(Outcome)**.
9. **Visualizing Relationships Between Features Using Pairplot**:
    - To explore the relationships between different features in the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and understand how they relate to the target variable **(Outcome)** using a pairplot.
10. **Creating a Logistic Regression Model**:
    - Created and assigned to the variable model.
11. **Training the Model**:
    - Using the training dataset **X_train** (features) and **y_train** (target variable).
12. **Making Predictions**:
    - Standardize test data, then predict class labels using trained model.
13. **Prediction for a Specific Input**:
    - Predict outcome using logistic regression model.
14. **Calculating Accuracy**:
    - Measures how accurate those predictions are compared to the true labels.
15. **Visualizing Predicted vs Actual Values**:
    - To compare the predicted outcomes from a classification model with the actual outcomes in the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, using a count plot for clear visual representation.
16. **Importing Confusion Matrix**:
    - This code creates a confusion matrix to visualize model performance by comparing actual and predicted outcomes.
17. **Calculating Precision**:
    - Precision indicates how many of the predicted positive cases were actually positive.
18. **Calculating F1 Score**:
    - Providing a balance between the two metrics.
19. **Calculating the Recall**:
    - Indicating how effectively the model identifies positive cases from the actual positives.

### H. Summary of Findings
**1.  Model's Ability to Classify**
 - **Classification Performance:** The logistic regression model is used to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on various health metrics. The effectiveness of this model can be assessed through several metrics:
  - **Accuracy:** An accuracy score around 82% indicates that the model is reasonably effective in distinguishing between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
  - **Precision:** The precision score indicates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.
  - **Recall:** Recall measures the model's ability to identify actual positive cases.

**2. Importance of Features**
 - **Feature Coefficients:** In logistic regression, the model assigns a coefficient to each feature, representing its influence on the probability of having diabetes:
  - **Positive Coefficients:** Features with positive coefficients increase the odds of diabetes. For example:
    - **Glucose Level:** Typically has a strong positive coefficient, indicating that higher glucose levels significantly elevate diabetes risk.
    - **Body Mass Index (BMI):** Generally shows a positive relationship, where increased BMI correlates with higher diabetes likelihood, reflecting obesity's role as a risk factor.
  - **Negative Coefficients:** Features with negative coefficients indicate a decrease in the odds of diabetes as the feature value increases. Understanding these relationships helps identify protective factors.
- **Key Features Influencing Diabetes:**
  - **Glucose:** Often the most critical predictor, as high glucose levels directly indicate diabetes risk.
  - **BMI:** Important for assessing obesity-related risks.
  - **Age:** Typically shows a positive correlation, with older individuals at greater risk.
  - **Insulin Levels and Blood Pressure:** These features also contribute significantly to diabetes prediction, indicating the model's capacity to incorporate a range of health metrics.

## Discussion of Regression Analysis Results

### A. Reflection on Results
- **Linear Regression**: 
    - The linear regression model achieved a **Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 8.1495**, suggesting a generally accurate fit. However, the presence of some prediction errors, possibly due to data noise or underlying non-linear relationships, indicates room for improvement.
    - An **R-squared value of 0.8284** reveals that the model explains 82.8% of the variance in housing prices, which indicates that it captures most key relationships in the data. 
    - The **Adjusted R-squared value of 0.8018** supports that most predictors are relevant to the target variable, **Median House Value (MEDV)**, by showing only a slight reduction from the R-squared value.
    - **Feature Impact Analysis** revealed that features like **Crime Rate (CRIM)** and **Nitric Oxide Concentration (NOX)** negatively impact housing prices, while features such as the **Average Number of Rooms (RM)** and **Accessibility to Highways (RAD)** positively influence prices.
    - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.23**
     - On average, the model's predictions are **only 2.23 units away** from the actual values, indicating **consistent and reliable predictions** close to real data.This low MAE demonstrates that the model maintains a **strong ability to generalize**, keeping most predictions close to observed values.
    - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 2.85**
     - The RMSE of 2.85, close to the MAE, reflects that **most predictions have small deviations** from the actual values.The RMSE slightly higher than MAE suggests that the model **handles variations well**, capturing both the general trend and some of the outliers effectively.This RMSE value showcases the model’s **robust performance** across different data points.

- **Logistic Regression**:
    - The logistic regression model achieved a **classification accuracy of around 82%**, effectively distinguishing between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
    - **Feature Coefficients Analysis** showed that **Glucose Level** and **Body Mass Index (BMI)** have strong positive coefficients, indicating that higher levels of these features increase the likelihood of diabetes. Other features, such as **Age** and **Insulin Levels**, also significantly impact diabetes risk.

### B. Comparison of the Two Regression Methods
- **Purpose of Each Model**:
    - **Linear Regression** is used to predict a continuous outcome (housing prices). It aims to find a straight-line relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable, so that the model's predictions closely match the actual values.
    - **Logistic Regression** is used for classification tasks, predicting a binary outcome (diabetic or non-diabetic). Instead of finding a line, logistic regression produces an "S-shaped" curve that estimates the probability of each class (in this case, the probability of being diabetic).

- **Model Performance**:
    - The **MSE and R-squared** in the linear regression model demonstrate how well the model predicts precise values of housing prices, while **accuracy, precision, and recall** in the logistic regression model measure how well it classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.
    - Linear regression results show a relatively strong fit to the data, while logistic regression’s accuracy of 82% suggests it is fairly effective for classification.

- **Feature Impact**:
    - Both models analyze the importance of features by assigning coefficients, but these coefficients reflect different outcomes. In linear regression, a positive coefficient indicates that as a feature value increases, the target value (housing price) increases as well. In logistic regression, a positive coefficient indicates that as a feature value increases, the probability of being diabetic also increases.

### C. Limitations
- **Linear Regression Limitations**:
    - Linear regression assumes a **linear relationship** between the predictors and the target variable. If the true relationship is non-linear, as may be the case with housing prices, the model may not fully capture all the nuances, leading to residual errors.
    - The **model is sensitive to outliers**, which can skew predictions and reduce accuracy, particularly when extreme values exist within the data.
    - **Multicollinearity** among features (where predictors are correlated with each other) can also affect the reliability of coefficients, leading to instability in the model’s predictions.

- **Logistic Regression Limitations**:
    - Logistic regression assumes a **linear relationship between predictors and the log odds** of the outcome, which may oversimplify complex relationships between health metrics and diabetes risk.
    - Similar to linear regression, **outliers** can affect model performance, and logistic regression may also be influenced by **imbalanced data**, where one outcome (e.g., diabetic or non-diabetic) is more prevalent. This can skew the model’s accuracy, as it may perform better on the more frequent class.
    - Logistic regression does not naturally handle **non-linear relationships** and may benefit from additional data preprocessing or transformation if non-linear patterns exist in the data.

Overall, while both models provide useful insights and relatively strong performance, limitations such as sensitivity to linear assumptions, outliers, and complex relationships could potentially impact their predictive power. Addressing these limitations through additional model adjustments or using more advanced algorithms could further improve predictive accuracy.

## Code of Linear Regression
**Part 1 - Data Preprocessing**

**Importing the dataset and libraries**

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import numpy as np # linear algebra
%matplotlib inline
from pandas import read_csv
#Lets load the dataset and sample some
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Suppress warnings for clean output
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

**Loading and Understanding the Dataset**

```python
# [rows,columns]
data = pd.read_csv('clearboston.csv')
data

```

```python
data.head(5) #display 5 rows of dataset

#10,000 rows
#data points collected from a combined cycle power plant over six years
#5 columns: AT ambient temp,V exhaust vacuum, AP ambient pressure, RH relative humdity, PE net hourly  electrical energy output
# independent variables: AT, V, AP and RH
# dependent variable: PE
```


```python
# Check dataset info
data.info()
```

```python
# Check for any missing values in the dataset
data.isnull().sum()
```

Checks for any missing values in the data.


```python
data.describe()
```

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
from scipy import stats

fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=7, nrows=2, figsize=(20, 10))
index = 0
axs = axs.flatten()
for k,v in data.items():
    sns.boxplot(y=k, data=data, ax=axs[index])
    index += 1
plt.tight_layout(pad=0.4, w_pad=0.5, h_pad=5.0)
```

Columns like CRIM, ZN, RM, B seems to have outliers. Let's see the outliers percentage in every column.

```python
for k, v in data.items():
        q1 = v.quantile(0.25)
        q3 = v.quantile(0.75)
        irq = q3 - q1
        v_col = v[(v <= q1 - 1.5 * irq) | (v >= q3 + 1.5 * irq)]
        perc = np.shape(v_col)[0] * 100.0 / np.shape(data)[0]
        print("Column %s outliers = %.2f%%" % (k, perc))
```

**Removing MEDV outliers (MEDV = 50.0) before plotting more distributions**

```python
data = data[~(data['MEDV'] >= 50.0)]
print(np.shape(data))
```

**Visualization of features plus MEDV distributions**

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=7, nrows=2, figsize=(20, 10))
index = 0
axs = axs.flatten()
for k,v in data.items():
    sns.distplot(v, ax=axs[index])
    index += 1
plt.tight_layout(pad=0.4, w_pad=0.5, h_pad=5.0)
```


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))
sns.heatmap(data.corr().abs(),  annot=True)
```

```python
from sklearn import preprocessing
# Let's scale the columns before plotting them against MEDV
min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()
column_sels = ['LSTAT', 'INDUS', 'NOX', 'PTRATIO', 'RM', 'TAX', 'DIS', 'AGE']
x = data.loc[:,column_sels]
y = data['MEDV']
x = pd.DataFrame(data=min_max_scaler.fit_transform(x), columns=column_sels)
fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=4, nrows=2, figsize=(20, 10))
index = 0
axs = axs.flatten()
for i, k in enumerate(column_sels):
    sns.regplot(y=y, x=x[k], ax=axs[i])
plt.tight_layout(pad=0.4, w_pad=0.5, h_pad=5.0)
```

So with these analysis, we may try predict MEDV with 'LSTAT', 'INDUS', 'NOX', 'PTRATIO', 'RM', 'TAX', 'DIS', 'AGE' features. Let's try to remove the skewness of the data trough log transformation.

```python
y =  np.log1p(y)
for col in x.columns:
    if np.abs(x[col].skew()) > 0.3:
        x[col] = np.log1p(x[col])
```

**Separating the Data (Features and Target)**

```python
# Extract features and target
X = data.drop('MEDV', axis=1)
y = data['MEDV']
#X: All the columns except# "MEDV" (the home price) are considered features (factors that help predict the home price).
#y: The "MEDV" column is th#e target (what we're trying to predict: the home price).
```

**Splitting the Data for Training and Testing**


```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=17)
```


```python
X_train
```

```python
X_test
```

```python
y_train
```

```python
y_test
```

```python
# Initialize and fit the StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Assuming X_train and X_test are DataFrames
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```


**Part 2 - Building and training the model**

**Building and Training the Model**

```python
# linear_model is the module
# LinearRegression is a class is defining that LinearRegression is a class within the linear_model module. 
# It indicates that LinearRegression is a blueprint or template for creating objects that represent linear regression models.
# Class is a pre-coded blueprint of something we want to build from which objects are created.
# Initialize and train the Linear Regression model

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
# fit is a method inside LinearRegression class - they are like functions.
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```

**Inference**

```python
cv_predictions = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
cv_predictions
```

**Making Predictions on New Data**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Convert DataFrames to NumPy arrays
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train.values)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test.values)

new_data = np.array([[0.02731, 18.0, 2.31, 0, 0.538, 6.575, 65.2, 4.0900, 1, 296.0, 15.3, 396.90, 4.98]])
new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)
predicted_value = model.predict(new_data_scaled)
print(f"Predicted Value: {predicted_value[0]:.2f}")
```

**Part 3: Evaluating the Model**

**Cross-Validation**

```python
# Perform cross-validation
cv_predictions = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
cv_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, cv_predictions)
print(f"Cross-Validation Mean Squared Error: {cv_mse:.4f}")
```

**R-Squared**

```python
r2 = r2_score(y_test, cv_predictions)
print(f"R-squared: {r2:.4f}")
```

**Adjusted R-Squared**

```python
k = X_test_scaled.shape[1]
n = X_test_scaled.shape[0]
adj_r2 = 1-(1-r2)*(n-1)/(n-k-1)
print("Adjusted R-squared:")
adj_r2
```

**Getting Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Assuming `y_test` is the actual values and `y_pred` is the predicted values from your model
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, cv_predictions)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, cv_predictions))

print(f"Mean Absolute Error (MAE): {mae}")
print(f"Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): {rmse}")
```


**Getting Coefficients and Intercept**

```python
print("Coefficients:")
print (model.coef_)

print("Intercept:")
print(model.intercept_)
```

**Comparing Actual vs Predicted Prices**

```python
results_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Actual Values': y_test.values,
    'Predicted Values': cv_predictions
})
results_df.head(10)
```


**Visualizing Predictions**

**Scatter Plot** 

```python
# Plotting the linear regression line
plt.scatter(y_test, cv_predictions, alpha=0.7, label='Predicted')
plt.plot([min(y_test), max(y_test)], [min(y_test), max(y_test)], linestyle='--', color='red', label='Perfect Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Actual Values')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Values')
plt.title('Predicted vs. Actual Values')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

```

**Residual Plot**

```python
# Calculate residuals (difference between actual and predicted values)
residuals = y_test - cv_predictions

# Create a residual plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(cv_predictions, residuals, alpha=0.7, color='blue')
plt.axhline(y=0, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Zero Error Line')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals')
plt.title('Residual Plot')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

## Code of Logistic Regression
**Data Processing**

**Import the Dataset**


```python
# Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
dataset = pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv')
```

```python
# Display the first 10 rows of the dataset to understand its structure and initial values
dataset.head(10)

```


```python
# Display dataset information, including column data types and non-null counts
dataset.info()
```


```python
# Check for any missing values in each column of the dataset
dataset.isnull().sum()
```

Checks for any missing values in the data.

**Getting Inputs and Output**


```python
# Separate features (X) and target variable (y) from the dataset
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values  # Select all columns except the last one as features
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values   # Select the last column as the target variable

```


```python
# Display feature values (X)
X
```

```python
# Display target variable values (y)
y
```

**Creating Training Set and the Test Set**


```python
# Import the train_test_split function to split the dataset into training and testing sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the data, reserving 20% for testing and using 80% for training
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Set options to control how values are printed in numpy arrays (for readability)
np.set_printoptions(suppress=True, precision=4)
```

The code splits a dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate a machine learning model's performance.

# Generate a heatmap to visualize correlation between features
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
corr = dataset.corr()  # Calculate the correlation matrix
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, fmt='.2f', cmap='coolwarm', square=True)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

```python
# Pairplot to visualize relationships between features, colored by 'Outcome'
sns.pairplot(dataset, hue='Outcome', palette='Set1')
plt.suptitle('Pairplot of Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset', y=1.02)
plt.show()
```

**Building and Training the Model**

**Building the Model**


```python
# Import LogisticRegression from scikit-learn to build the classification model
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Initialize the logistic regression model with a random state for reproducibility
model = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)
```

**Training the model**


```python
# Train (fit) the model using the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

```


```python
# Make predictions on the test set after scaling
y_pred = model.predict(sc.transform(X_test))
```


```python
# Display the predicted outcomes for the test set
y_pred

```

```python
# Display the actual outcomes for the test set
y_test
```


```python
# Example predictions using new data instances
model.predict(sc.transform([[6, 148, 72, 35, 0, 33.6, 0.627, 50]]))  # New patient 1


```



```python
model.predict(sc.transform([[1, 85, 66, 29, 0, 26.6, 0.351, 31]]))   # New patient 2
```

**Evaluating the Model**

**Accuracy** 


```python
# Import accuracy_score metric to evaluate prediction accuracy of the model
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Calculate and display the accuracy of the model on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(sc.transform(X_test))  # Make predictions on test set
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  # Calculate and display accuracy
```

**Visualization**


```python
# Create a DataFrame to compare actual vs predicted values
results = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred})

# Visualize the count of actual vs predicted diabetes outcomes
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(data=results.melt(), x='value', hue='variable', palette='Set2')
plt.title('Predicted vs Actual Diabetes Outcomes')
plt.xlabel('Outcome')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.xticks(ticks=[0, 1], labels=['No Diabetes', 'Diabetes'])
plt.legend(title='Legend', labels=['Actual', 'Predicted'])
plt.show()
```

```python
# Import confusion_matrix to visualize model performance on classification
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Generate a confusion matrix for actual vs predicted outcomes
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Plot the confusion matrix to show true positives, false positives, etc.
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues',
            xticklabels=['No Diabetes', 'Diabetes'],
            yticklabels=['No Diabetes', 'Diabetes'])
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.ylabel('True Label')
plt.show()
```

```python
# Calculate and display the accuracy using confusion matrix components
(98 + 29) / (98 + 29 + 18 + 9)
```

```python
# Import and calculate F1 Score for model performance
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

# Compute F1 score, which considers both precision and recall, for the model
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")
```

```python
# Import and calculate Recall Score for model performance
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

# Compute recall score to measure sensitivity to positive outcomes
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Recall: {recall:.4f}")
```
